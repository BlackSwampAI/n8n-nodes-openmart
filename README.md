# Black Swamp n8n community-node template

A fail-closed TypeScript starter for production-quality n8n community integrations. It retains n8n's useful Example and GitHub Issues implementations for study, adds strict Vitest tests, release audits, and provenance-ready GitHub Actions.

> [!WARNING]
> This repository is a template, not a publishable integration. `private: true` intentionally blocks publication. The examples, identity, and this README must be removed or adapted after generating a project.

## Start from the template

1. Select **Use this template → Create a new repository** on GitHub.
2. Create the final public repository, then clone it.
3. Work in bounded, reviewed batches; do not create a version tag during initialization.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-OWNER/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
cd YOUR-REPOSITORY
npm ci
```

## Deterministic initialization checklist

- Choose the final GitHub repository and scoped or unscoped `n8n-nodes-*` npm name.
- Replace package name, description, author, homepage, repository, keywords, and node metadata URLs/categories. Black Swamp AI packages use `https://blackswampai.com/n8n-nodes/<slug>/` as their npm homepage.
- Choose and document exactly one distribution state: verified-node discovery, manual self-hosted **Settings → Community Nodes**, or private/unavailable. Verification status must come from the actual n8n distribution state, not package metadata.
- Replace this file with `README_TEMPLATE.md`, rename it to `README.md`, and resolve every placeholder.
- Remove or adapt the Example and GitHub Issues nodes, credentials, icons, and registrations.
- Replace or remove raw-template invariant tests, especially `tests/template.test.ts`, when removing `private: true` and the example registrations; add product-specific invariants in their place.
- Copy and complete `docs/API_MATRIX_TEMPLATE.md` as `docs/api-matrix.md`, `docs/TESTING_TEMPLATE.md` as `docs/testing.md`, and `docs/BRANDING_TEMPLATE.md` as `docs/branding.md`. Remove the uppercase template copies after migration; unresolved placeholders or missing final documents fail the generated repository's release audit.
- Register every intended compiled node and credential using stable `dist/` paths.
- Keep `private: true` until identity, documentation, tests, and registration are final; then remove it.
- Run `npm install` once after identity/tooling changes and commit the regenerated lockfile.
- Start follow-up/migration branches from the current post-squash `main`. Do not replay an already-squashed feature branch.
- Inspect inherited `.npmrc` files. `engine-strict=true` must not reject either the Node 22.22.0 or Node 24 CI lane.
- Run `npm run format:check`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, and `npm run package:check`.
- Install or load the dry-run package in a disposable n8n instance before release.
- Never tag early. Only an explicitly authorized, reviewed release commit receives an immutable version tag.

## Examples included

- `nodes/Example/`: minimal programmatic node.
- `nodes/GithubIssues/` and `credentials/`: declarative API node, list search, pagination helper, PAT, and OAuth examples.

These are learning fixtures. Shipping their names, registrations, or credentials in an unrelated integration is a release-audit failure.

## Development commands

| Command                 | Purpose                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`           | Run the local n8n node development environment      |
| `npm run format:check`  | Check formatting                                    |
| `npm run lint`          | Run n8n community-node lint rules                   |
| `npm run typecheck`     | Strictly check production and test TypeScript       |
| `npm test`              | Run all `*.test.ts` files with Vitest               |
| `npm run build`         | Compile nodes and copy static assets                |
| `npm run scan:source`   | Apply the pinned official scanner to source/build   |
| `npm run release:check` | Validate template mode or final release identity    |
| `npm run package:check` | Audit and inspect the dry-run npm tarball boundary  |
| `npm run smoke:load`    | Load every compiled package registration            |
| `npm run smoke:install` | Install and load the tarball in an isolated project |

The tag workflow separates one-time npm publication from a dependent registry/provenance verifier. If npm publication succeeds and only verification fails, rerun only failed jobs; never rerun the successful publish job for that immutable version.

Read `RELEASING.md` before changing `private`, creating a tag, or configuring npm publishing.
Use `docs/BATCH_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md` to keep implementation work bounded and evidence-driven. Generated repositories do not inherit later template improvements; follow `docs/TEMPLATE_MIGRATIONS.md` and retain `.blackswamp/template.json` to track explicitly adopted migrations.

Reusable project templates:

- `docs/API_MATRIX_TEMPLATE.md`
- `docs/TESTING_TEMPLATE.md`
- `docs/BRANDING_TEMPLATE.md`
